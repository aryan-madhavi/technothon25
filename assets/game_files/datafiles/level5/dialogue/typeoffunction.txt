🔥 Types of Functions in Python 🚀
Functions in Python can be classified into different types based on how they work and where they come from! Let's break it down!

1️⃣ Built-in Functions (Already There!)
These are pre-defined functions that come with Python. You can use them without writing any extra code!

✅ Examples:
print() – Displays output.
len() – Finds the length of a string or list.
max() – Finds the largest number in a list.
print(len("Python"))  # Output: 6
print(max(5, 10, 3))  # Output: 10

2️⃣ User-Defined Functions (DIY Functions) 🛠
These are functions created by programmers to perform specific tasks. You define them using def and call them when needed.

✅ Example:
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}! 😊")
greet("Alice")  # Output: Hello, Alice! 😊

3️⃣ Lambda Functions (Tiny but Powerful!) ⚡
These are one-liner functions that don’t need a name! They are mostly used for short, quick calculations.

✅ Example:
square = lambda x: x * x
print(square(4))  # Output: 16
(🔥 Shortcut Alert! Instead of writing a full function, just use lambda!)
