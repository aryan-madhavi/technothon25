ğŸ“Œ Tuple Methods in Python ğŸ”¥

ğŸ”¹ Finding Elements in a Tuple
You can check for an item using the in keyword and find its index using .index().
print("banana" in fruits)  # Output: True
print(fruits.index("cherry"))  # Output: 2

ğŸ”¹ Counting Occurrences
Use .count() to see how many times an element appears.
numbers = (1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5)
print(numbers.count(2))  # Output: 3

ğŸ”¹ Tuple Operations
ğŸ”¹ Concatenation & Repeating
A = (1, 2, 3)
B = (4, 5, 6)
print(A + B)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
print(A * 2)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3)

ğŸ”¹ Converting a List to a Tuple
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_tuple = tuple(my_list)
print(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3)

ğŸ“Œ Key Takeaways
âœ… Tuples are immutable, ordered collections.
âœ… Faster than lists for lookup operations.
âœ… Used when data should not change.
âœ… Supports indexing, slicing, and basic operations.

ğŸš€ Tuples are great for storing fixed, unchangeable data efficiently! ğŸ”¥
