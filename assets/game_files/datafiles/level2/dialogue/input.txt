In Python, the `input()` function is used to get data from a user. It allows the program to pause and wait for user input, storing the entered value as a string.

Key Points:
- Functionality: `input()` takes user input and returns it as a string.
- Prompting: A message inside `input()` can guide the user on what to enter.
- String Return Type:** Input is always stored as a string.

Example:
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello,", name)

Important Considerations:
- Type Conversion: Since input is always a string, use `int()` or `float()` if numerical input is needed.
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
print("Your age is:", age)
- Error Handling: Always validate user input to ensure it matches the expected format.
