🎯 Attributes in Python – The DNA of Objects! 🚀
🔍 What are Attributes?
Attributes are like the characteristics of an object. Just like a car has a color, a model, and a speed, objects in Python have attributes that define their properties.

In simple terms:
✅ Attributes = Variables that belong to an object
✅ Methods = Functions that belong to an object

⚙ Types of Attributes
1️ Instance Attributes – Unique to each object
Each object has its own separate copy of these attributes.
class Car:
    def __init__(self, color, model):
        self.color = color  # Instance Attribute
        self.model = model  # Instance Attribute
🚗 Different cars can have different colors and models!

2️ Class Attributes – Shared by all objects
Class attributes belong to the class itself, not individual objects.
class Car:
    wheels = 4  # Class Attribute (Same for all cars)
🌍 All cars have 4 wheels by default!

3️ Private Attributes – Hidden from outside access
Use double underscores (__) to make an attribute private.
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.__balance = balance  # Private Attribute

account = BankAccount(1000)
print(account.__balance)  # ❌ This will give an error!
🔒 Private attributes can't be accessed directly from outside!

🛠 Modifying Attributes
You can update attributes like this:
my_car = Car("Red", "Sedan")
my_car.color = "Blue"  # Changing the attribute value
🎨 Your red car just turned blue!

🎯 Key Takeaways:
🔹 Instance attributes are unique for each object.
🔹 Class attributes are shared by all objects.
🔹 Private attributes restrict direct access.
🔹 You can modify attributes anytime!

💡 Think of attributes as the unique ID card of an object! 📇
