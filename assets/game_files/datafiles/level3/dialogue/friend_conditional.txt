In Python, conditionals execute different code blocks based on whether a condition is true or false. For example, checking if an age is below 10:
\t age = 5
\t if age < 10:
\t     print("Valid age")
If `age` is 5, it prints "Valid age." Indentation is crucial.
@END

If-else statements handle alternative cases:
\t outfit = perfect
\t if outfit == "perfect":
\t     print("To wear tonight")
\t else:
\t     print("Second option")
If `oufit` is perfect, it prints "To wear tonight" Indentation is crucial.
@END

The elif statement checks multiple conditions:
\t a = 18
\t b = 5
\t if a > b:
\t    print("A is greater")
\t elif a < b:
\t     print("A is less")
\t elif a == b:
\t     print("A and B are equal")
\t else:
\t     print("Invalid")
Since `a > b`, it prints `A is greater`.Indentation is crucial.

Operators like ==, !=, <, >, <=, and >= compare values, while `and`, `or`, and `not` combine conditions. Indentation is essential for structuring conditionals in Python.
