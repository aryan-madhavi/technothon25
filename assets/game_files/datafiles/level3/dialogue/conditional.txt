Conditional statements allow a program to execute different code blocks depending on whether a condition is true or false.
Key Points About Conditionals
- They control the flow of a program by selectively executing code based on conditions.
- Conditional statements use the `if` keyword followed by a condition.
- Components:
  - if statement: Executes a code block if the condition is true.
  - else statement: Executes a code block if the `if` condition is false.
  - elif statement: Allows checking multiple conditions sequentially.

@START
If Statement
Executes a block of code only if the condition is met.
\t age = 5
\t if age < 18:
\t     print("INVALID age")
Output:
\t INVALID age
@END
@START
If-Else Statement
Executes the `else` block if the `if` condition is false.
\t outfit = input("How does your outfit look? ") 
\t if outfit == "perfect":
\t     print("To wear tonight! ")
\t else:
\t     print("Second option! ")
Output:
\t How does your outfit look? okay  #Example input is notgood
\t Second option! 
@END 
@START
Elif Statement
Checks multiple conditions in sequence.
\t a = 10
\t b = 15
\t if a > b:
\t     print("A is greater")
\t elif a < b:
\t     print("A is less")
\t elif a == b:
\t     print("A and B are equal")
\t else:
\t     print("Invalid")
Output:
\t A is less
@END

Important Aspects of Conditionals
- Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` compare values.
- Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not` combine multiple conditions.
- Indentation: Python requires proper indentation to define blocks of code.
