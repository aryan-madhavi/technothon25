Conditional Statements in Python
Conditional statements are like life decisions—"If this happens, do that; otherwise, do something else."

if Statement
"If it's raining, take an umbrella!"—Simple logic, right? Python works the same way.
weather = "rainy"
if weather == "rainy":
    print("Take an umbrella! ☔")
if-else Statement

"If the coffee is hot, drink it. Otherwise, wait."
coffee_temp = 90
if coffee_temp > 80:
    print("Drink carefully! 🔥")
else:
    print("Wait a bit. 🧊")
elif (else if) Statement

Sometimes, there are multiple choices.
"If you get an A, celebrate! If you get a B, feel good. Otherwise, try harder next time."
grade = "B"
if grade == "A":
    print("Yay! You nailed it! 🎉")
elif grade == "B":
    print("Good job! 👍")
else:
    print("Keep going! 💪")
