Relational Expressions
Think of relational expressions as ways to compare things. They help answer questions like "Is this bigger?" or "Are these the same?" by returning True or False.
Common ones:
== (equal to) → Checks if two values are the same.
!= (not equal to) → Checks if two values are different.
<, >, <=, >= → Compare values (less than, greater than, etc.).
Example:
age = 18
print(age >= 18)  # True (because 18 is equal to 18)

Logical Expressions
Logical expressions help combine multiple conditions. They act like filters in decision-making.
and → All conditions must be true.
or → At least one condition must be true.
not → Reverses the condition (True becomes False, and vice versa).
Example:
age = 20
has_ID = True
print(age >= 18 and has_ID)  # True (both conditions are met)
