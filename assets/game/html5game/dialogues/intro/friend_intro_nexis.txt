Here are some convincing key points about Python and its need
-	Python is a language that can be used for a wide range of applications, 
from simple scripting to complex data analysis and machine learning 
i.e from cooking Maggie to cooking something difficult.
-	Code execution is no complex just simple line 
after line without any extr-ordinary compilation steps 
which is a benefit for testing quick and development.
-	Also it supports Object â€“ Oriented concepts such as classes and objects which are quiet easy.
- Python is a chill guy 
and hence do not need to explicitly declare variables with data-types, 
which makes it more concise.
-	Readability of python with clean syntax along with clear keywords 
and significant whitespaces for code indentation,
which makes it easy to read and fun to understand.
-	Python has a motherly nature 
and hence has a vast collection of pre-built modules 
and libraries for several tasks.
