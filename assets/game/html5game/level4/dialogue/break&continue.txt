🔥 Break & Continue in Python – The Game Changers of Loops! 🚀
Loops are powerful, but sometimes you need more control over them. That’s where break and continue come in! Let’s check them out.

🛑 break – Exit a Loop Early
Think of watching a movie. If you lose interest halfway, you just leave instead of watching till the end. That’s what break does – it stops the loop immediately!

Example: Stop at 3
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        break  # Stops when i is 3
    print(i)
Output:
1  
2  
🚀 What happened? The loop stopped completely when i became 3!

⏭ continue – Skip & Move On
Imagine skipping a song in a playlist but still listening to the next one. That’s what continue does – it skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.

Example: Skip 3, Print Others
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        continue  # Skips when i is 3
    print(i)
Output:
1  
2  
4  
5  

🚀 What happened? When i was 3, Python skipped that iteration and moved on!
🎯 When to Use?
✅ Use break when you want to stop the loop completely once a condition is met.
✅ Use continue when you want to skip something but keep looping.

💡 Quick Recap:
🔹 break → Stops the loop immediately.
🔹 continue → Skips the current iteration but keeps looping.
These two simple tricks give you total control over loops! 🚀🔥
