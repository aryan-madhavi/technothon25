Loops in Python – What, How, and Why?
Loops are like a repeat button in programming! 🎵 Instead of writing the same code multiple times, we automate repetition using loops.

🔹 What is a Loop?
A loop is a way to repeat a block of code multiple times until a condition is met.

Imagine you are doing jumping jacks in a workout. Instead of saying "jump" 20 times, you say:
"Repeat jumping 20 times!" – That’s exactly how loops work!

🔹 How Do Loops Work?
Python has two main types of loops:
1️. For Loop – Used when we know how many times we need to repeat something.
2. While Loop – Runs as long as a condition remains true.

Example of a For Loop
for i in range(5):  # Runs 5 times (0 to 4)
    print("Hello!")
Output:
Hello!  
Hello!  
Hello!  
Hello!  
Hello! 

Example of a While Loop
i = 1
while i <= 5:  # Runs while i is 5 or less
    print(i)
    i += 1
Output:
1  
2  
3  
4  
5  

-Why Use Loops?
✅ Saves Time – No need to write the same code again and again.
✅ Reduces Errors – Instead of making mistakes copying code, loops handle repetition perfectly.
✅ Works with Data – Easily process lists, files, user input, and more.
✅ Automation – From checking emails to running a program continuously, loops are everywhere!

🚀 In Short:
-What? A way to repeat code.
-How? Using for or while loops.
-Why? To save time, reduce errors, and automate tasks!
Loops make coding faster, smarter, and more efficient! 🔥
