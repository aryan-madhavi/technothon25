While Loops in Python 
A while loop is like waiting for something to happenâ€”you keep doing a task until a condition is met.
Real-Life Example
Think about waiting for your phone to fully charge.
-If your battery is less than 100%, you keep charging.
-Once it reaches 100%, you stop charging and unplug.
This is exactly how a while loop works in Python!

Basic While Loop
Letâ€™s say we want to count from 0 to 4:
i = 0
while i < 5:  # As long as i is less than 5, keep looping
    print(i)
i += 1  # Increase i by 1 in each loop
Output:
0  
1  
2  
3  
4  
Here,
-The loop starts with i = 0.
-It checks if i < 5. If true, it runs the code inside.
-After printing i, it adds 1 (i += 1).
-The loop stops when i = 5 because the condition i < 5 is now false.

The Danger of Infinite Loops
Be careful! If you forget to update i, the loop never stops!

i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)  # Oops! Forgot to increment i!
This keeps printing 0 foreverâ€”Python wonâ€™t stop unless you forcefully exit. ðŸ˜¬
