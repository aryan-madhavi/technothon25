For Loop in Python 
A for loop in Python is like playing a playlistâ€”it goes through each song (or item) one by one and performs an action. ðŸŽµ

Basic For Loop
Imagine you have a list of your favorite snacks, and you want to print each one.
snacks = ["Chips", "Chocolate", "Cookies"]
for snack in snacks:
    print(snack)
Output:
mathematica
Copy
Edit
Chips  
Chocolate  
Cookies  

The loop picks one item at a time from the list and prints it.
When there are no more items left, the loop stops automatically.

Using range() in For Loop
What if you want to repeat something a fixed number of times? Thatâ€™s where range() helps!

Example (Counting Numbers):
for i in range(5):  # Loops from 0 to 4
    print(i)
Output:
0  
1  
2  
3  
4  
range(5) generates numbers from 0 to 4 (5 is not included).
Example (Custom Start & Step Size):
python
for i in range(1, 10, 2):  # Start at 1, stop before 10, step by 2
    print(i)
Output:
1  
3  
5  
7  
9  
The loop starts from 1, jumps by 2, and stops before 10.
