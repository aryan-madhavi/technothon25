ZENON
I am ZENON, Let me introduce you to the Python Language
This will help you to defeat your enemies
...Let's get started...
Python is a high-level, interpreted, object-oriented programming language
known for its simplicity and readability
Developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s,
making it a popular choice for beginners and experienced developers alike
it is often used for web development,
data analysis, machine learning, and automation tasks,
with a key feature being its reliance on whitespace indentation
to define code blocks,
rather than curly brackets like many other languages
the name 'Python' is a reference to the British comedy group
'Monty Python', and to any Snake type.
