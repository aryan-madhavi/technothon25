🚗 Classes & Objects in Python – The Blueprint of Life! 🎨
🎭 What’s a Class?
A class is like a blueprint or template used to create multiple objects. Think of it as a recipe 🍳—it defines what ingredients (attributes) and steps (methods) are needed, but you can use it to create different dishes (objects)!

Imagine This:
You want to make thousands of cars. Instead of designing each car separately, you create a blueprint that defines the basic features of a car—like color, wheels, and model.

👨‍🏭 The Class Defines:
✅ Properties (Attributes) – Things like color, wheels, and model.
✅ Actions (Methods) – Things the car can do, like honking or driving.

🚙 What’s an Object?
An object is a real instance of a class. Think of it as an actual car created from the blueprint. 🏎️
Each car (object) follows the same structure but can have different properties.

For example, from our Car class, we can create:

A red sedan with 4 wheels.
A blue sports car with 4 wheels.
Even though they are different cars, they are both objects of the same class!

🏗 Class & Object in Python (Only Essentials)
class Car:
    def __init__(self, color, model):
        self.color = color
        self.model = model

    def drive(self):
        print(f"The {self.color} {self.model} is driving!")

my_car = Car("red", "Sedan")  # Creating an object
my_car.drive()  # Output: The red Sedan is driving!

🎯 Key Takeaways:
🔹 A class is a blueprint that defines attributes & behaviors.
🔹 An object is an instance of a class.
🔹 Objects can have different values but follow the same structure.
🔹 Methods define what an object can do, like drive().

💡 Fun Fact: Everything in Python—numbers, strings, lists—is actually an object of some class! 🧠
