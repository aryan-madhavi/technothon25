👑 Inheritance in Python – Passing Down the Power! 🚀
🏛 What is Inheritance?
Inheritance is like getting traits from your parents! 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
In Python, a class can inherit properties and methods from another class, so you don’t have to rewrite the same code again and again.

Imagine a general blueprint for a vehicle 🚗, but then we create specific types like Car and Bike, which share some common features but also have their own unique traits.

🏗 Why Use Inheritance?
✅ Code Reusability – No need to rewrite the same code for similar classes.
✅ Organization – Keep common features in a base class and extend only what’s necessary.
✅ Flexibility – Easily modify or extend functionality without breaking other parts.

⚙ How Inheritance Works?
👨‍👦 Parent & Child Classes
Parent Class (Base Class) – The main class with common features.
Child Class (Derived Class) – Inherits from the parent and can add its own features.
📝 Syntax:
class Vehicle:  # Parent Class
    def __init__(self, brand):
        self.brand = brand

    def show_brand(self):
        print(f"This is a {self.brand} vehicle.")

class Car(Vehicle):  # Child Class inheriting from Vehicle
    def drive(self):
        print(f"The {self.brand} car is driving!")

my_car = Car("Tesla")  # Creating an object of Car
my_car.show_brand()  # Inherited method
my_car.drive()  # Child class method

🏎️ Types of Inheritance in Python
1️ Single Inheritance – One child inherits from one parent.
2️ Multiple Inheritance – A child class inherits from multiple parents.
3️ Multilevel Inheritance – A class inherits from another class, which itself is a child of another class.
4️ Hierarchical Inheritance – Multiple child classes inherit from a single parent.

🎯 Key Takeaways:
🔹 Inheritance lets child classes reuse and extend parent class features.
🔹 Reduces code duplication and keeps things organized.
🔹 Child classes can add their own unique methods while keeping common ones.
🔹 You can override parent class methods for customization.
