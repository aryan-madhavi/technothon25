📌 Lists in Python – Definition & Usage! 🚀
A list in Python is like a supercharged shopping cart 🛒—it holds multiple items, keeps them in order, and lets you change them whenever needed!
🔹 What is a List?
A list is a collection of items stored in square brackets []. These items can be numbers, strings, or even other lists!
🔹 Lists are:
✅ Ordered – Items stay in the same order.
✅ Mutable – You can change them after creation.
✅ Allow duplicates – Can store the same value multiple times.

🎯 How to Create a List?

# Empty list
my_list = []
# List with numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# List with mixed types
mixed = ["apple", 10, 3.5, True]
🔥 Yes! Lists can hold anything—numbers, words, even Booleans!

🔹 Accessing List Items
You can grab list items using their index (starting from 0).
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "grapes"]
print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple
print(fruits[-1]) # Output: grapes (negative index)
🛑 Remember: Python starts counting from 0!

🎯 When to Use Lists?
✔ When you need to store multiple values
✔ When you want ordered and changeable data
✔ When you need easy access & modification

🚀 Lists are one of Python’s most powerful tools—Master them and make coding life easier! 🔥
