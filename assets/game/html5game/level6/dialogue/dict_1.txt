📌 Dictionaries in Python – Quick Guide! 🚀
A dictionary is like your phone’s contact list 📞—it stores data in key-value pairs inside {} for quick lookups!

🔹 Why Use Dictionaries?
✅ Unordered – No fixed position
✅ Mutable – Can add, remove, modify
✅ Fast Lookups – Access data quickly

🎯 Creating a Dictionary
student = {
    "name": "Alex",
    "age": 21,
    "course": "Computer Engineering"
}
🔹 Accessing & Modifying Data
print(student["name"])  # Alex  
print(student.get("age"))  # 21  

student["grade"] = "A"  # Adding a new key-value pair
🔹 Looping Through a Dictionary
for key, value in student.items():
    print(key, ":", value)
    
🎯 When to Use?
✔ Need fast lookups 🔍
✔ Data requires labels 🏷
✔ Order doesn’t matter ✅

🚀 Dictionaries keep data structured & accessible! 🔥
