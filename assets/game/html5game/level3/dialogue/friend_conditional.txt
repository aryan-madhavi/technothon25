Conditional Statements
In Python, conditionals execute different code blocks based on whether a condition is true or false. For example, checking if an age is below 10:
if age < 10:
    print("Valid age")
If `age` is 5, it prints "Valid age." Indentation is crucial.

If-else statements handle alternative cases:
if outfit == "perfect":
    print("To wear tonight")
else:
    print("Second option")
The elif statement checks multiple conditions:
if a > b:
    print("A is greater")
elif a < b:
    print("A is less")
elif a == b:
    print("A and B are equal")
else:
    print("Invalid")
Operators like ==, !=, <, >, <=, and >= compare values, while `and`, `or`, and `not` combine conditions. Indentation is essential for structuring conditionals in Python.
